SHOW CREATE TABLE sales_customer;


ORM


#fetch everything
lBooks = DBSession.query(Book)  #returns a Query object. 
for oBook in lBooks:
    print oBook.name

#simple filters
lBooks = DBSession.query(Book).filter_by(author_id=1) #returns all the books for a specific author

#more complex filters
lBooks = DBSession.query(Book).filter(Book.price<20) #returns all the books with price <20. Note we use filter, not filter_by

#filters can be combined
lBooks = DBSession.query(Book).filter_by(author_id=1).filter(Book.price<20) #all books by a specific author, with price<20
